Will consist of a database containing articles and books with keywords and path to them.
All of this will be stored on my server so as to make it centralised.

Note on name: Eratosthenes was the chief librarian of the Library of Alexandria. He was also a polymath who invented the concepts of latitude and longitude. His qualifications make him suitable to take care of my collection of knowledge.
